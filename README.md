# python_api_homework

WeatherPy_Pascarella and VacationPy_Pascarella are final jupyter files for submission of homework.
All charts are labeled and exported in repo. 
Comments on each charts are below reach respective chart, in the notebooks themselves, as suggested by the instructions.
The Google maps would not export correctly.  It was suggested by TA's to simply download and save the files - these are also in repo.
Very challenging homework - learned a lot and need to spend more time practicing calling json data! 

I worked several hours with tutor + TA's on attempting to correctly hide API key.  I thought I had the process correct it still shows in checkpoints. 
I will delete it as soon as this homework is graded. 


Had a tutor session Friday after this was submitted.  She showed me better ways to do things - please grade the commit I made on VacationPy Thursday night to be fair!
